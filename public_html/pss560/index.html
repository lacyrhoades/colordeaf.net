  <p>The PSS-560 from the late 1980s features, among other features, a 2-operator FM synthesizer and several PCM drum sounds. The 470 and 570 models do not have the PCM sounds, and are a different color. These are the primay differences. They all makes great noises and consist of several delicate parts which at times may need attention. Most internals can be very well cleaned with rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs.</p>

  <p>The rear panel gives two line out jacks which can get dirty with age.</p>

  <p>After removing the rear panel you'll find the boards are all connected permanently by ribbon wire. To work on the internals, this is a good way to lay out the parts, by laying the main interface face-down and essentially unfolding the parts onto an elevated surface just beyond the main body.</p>

  <p>The most important thing to know about are these sliders. The tiny parts are easily lost and they are only retained by the slider's position in the chassis, so be very careful. These parts would all be very hard to replace. In all electronic repairs I've never encountered something so fragile and nerve-wracking. You must use tweezers to manipulate this tiny ball bearing back into place. The little metal feelers should be carefully cleaned. They seem brittle though I did not manage to break any of them.</p>

  <p>These are the LED caps which focus the LED light through the front panel. These appear yellow, possibly due to age or exposure to cigarette smoke.</p>

  <p>This is the front panel, behind the main control board.</p>

  <p>These are the switch caps. Different color ones go in different places but they're all the same shape. These are discolored on top from what looks like smoking, and they were very dirty.</p>
