  <p>This is the basic PCB (which was actually left out of my kit initially..) with the two DIP connectors stuck in there, along with some resistors and diodes. I wanted to get a picture of the unaltered PCB but I was too eager after waiting for it to arrive. I built it in one night.</p>

  <p>Here's the topside. Also looks great. This is probably after midnight.</p>

  <p>The whole unit is supposed to run off of 9v DC though a 7809 regulator, which drops a couple of volts off the input. So then the unit is really "supposed" to run off of 7-something volts, though the op amps are spec'd for 9. I put this in there, sort of as an experiment. It's a 7809 wired for 12v input, with reverse polarity. There's still a knob on the top side to adjust the power to lower levels. Here's the first demo of the sounds: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSViIOVk4VY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSViIOVk4VY</a></p>
