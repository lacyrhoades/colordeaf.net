  <p>This domain was registered with a credit card in 2003 to publicize a number of vague forthcoming projects and to share whatever pithy text I deemed appropriate and oblique enough for the users of the world wide web. The credit limit on that card was $300. I am informed that limit has grown by a factor of 100x in the years since. The rest, however, has remained mostly the same.</p>
